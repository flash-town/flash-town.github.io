Orgs Work, Job

#Orgs Work, Job

Work—mental and physical tasks to produce goods and services for human needs—is a central activity in all societies. It is a major source of an individual’s social position and social relationships, identity, and sense of well-being. Jobs and professions are ways work can be organized in return for pay, and economic organizations are the main contexts within which work is performed in contemporary societies.
